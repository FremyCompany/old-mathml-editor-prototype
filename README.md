# FremyCompany's Math Equation Editor (WPF+VB)

This is a really old project, totally unmaintained for years, 
but since [codeplex](https://equationeditor.codeplex.com/) is shutting down I figured out I should import the code into GitHub. 
I think there is some good stuff to discover here, but it is largely incomplete. 

**The only reason I still care about this project is nostalgy.** 
This is one of the first complex software I wrote, and 
it prefigures so much of the reasons why I was interested into working on designing HTML and CSS. 

I must have an older, messier (but feature-completier) version of this that worked using GDI, 
but it must be deep inside backup archives and I'll probably never again take a look back at it, 
so getting this one saved online somewhere feels somewhat important to the code-sentimental me.

So, if you are just watching my account for shiny new things, move on ;-)
